I came to the States when I was 19 and didn't know the language. My first struggle was to learn english in a world where I was too old for highschool and not fit for college. My first computer job was in tech support in my mid 20s and that lasted through three job changes until sometime in my mid 30s. During all this time I was doing web design and development as a hobby but I knew I wanted to do it as a full time job. In 2016 I got a break at my job and became a developer.

I felt like I finally had arrived, but I quickly learned I had a lot of catching up to do. At the time I did not know a specific language except HTML and CSS
