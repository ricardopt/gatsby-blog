In a fast moving industry like ours, it is imperative that we have tools that allow us to build environments (front and back-end), quickly while providing consistency. The same way we have DevOps processes for quickly spinning off a complete Drupal website built with composer, Drush, Drupal Console and more, we need a system that automates the Drupal theme creation process in an effort to provide all the essential tools needed for a modern, best practices, and standards compliant front-end environment.  Take a look at my walkthrough of Mediacurrent's Theme Generator to see how our team achieves consistency across projects while adhering to standards and best practices for creating and working with Drupal themes.
